# Social-Network-API

## Description
This is a back end for a social media app using mongo DB.

AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database


SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
